1) Download IOT Remote onto phone.
2) Upgrade and include magnetic sensor data on dashboard.
3) Press each button and record all buttons and their corresponding magnetic signature from wear and small mechanical differences.
4) Place phone near gate keypad entrance.
5) Record signatures.
6) Take signatures, the peaks and troughs and match to recorded signal and corresponding button.

Note: Buttons with more wear should work better. Also, maybe applying a coat of various magnetic materials, such as very tiny magnetic spheres or even some sort of solder, etc can help to differentiate buttons.
