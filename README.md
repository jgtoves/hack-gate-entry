1) Download IOT Remote onto phone.
2) Upgrade and include audio, or, magnetic sensor data on dashboard.
3) Press each button and record all buttons and their corresponding magnetic signature from wear and small mechanical differences using screen recording software. Notice precise X and Y Axis levels.
4) Place phone near gate keypad entrance and wait.
5) Record signatures, again with screen recording software.
6) Take signatures, the peaks and troughs and match to recorded signal and corresponding button.

Note: Buttons with more wear should work better. Also, maybe applying a coat of various materials, such as very tiny magnetic spheres or even some sort of solder, etc can help to differentiate buttons.
